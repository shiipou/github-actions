# GitHub Actions Reusable Workflows Collection

A comprehensive collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows designed to streamline your CI/CD pipeline. This project provides modular, composable workflows that can be chained together to create powerful and customizable automation for your projects.

## üéØ Purpose

This collection aims to:
- Reduce duplication in GitHub Actions workflows across projects
- Provide standardized, tested workflow components
- Enable quick setup of complex CI/CD pipelines
- Support multiple platforms and frameworks (Spring Boot, Flutter, Docker)

## üöÄ Quick Start

To use these workflows in your project, reference them in your GitHub Actions workflow file:

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  version:
    uses: shiipou/github-actions/.github/workflows/get-version.yml@main
    
  build:
    needs: version
    if: needs.version.outputs.version != ''
    uses: shiipou/github-actions/.github/workflows/build-springboot.yml@main
    with:
      version: ${{ needs.version.outputs.version }}
```
